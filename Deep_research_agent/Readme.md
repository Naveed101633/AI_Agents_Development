# üîé Multi-Agent Hybrid Research System

This project implements a **multi-agent research framework** that plans, searches, and synthesizes information into professional reports. Inspired by human research workflows, the system uses a **plan ‚Üí search ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí report** pipeline instead of simple Q&A.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Planning Agent** ‚Üí Decomposes queries into actionable research steps.  
- **Web Search Agent** ‚Üí Executes hybrid searches across **Tavily** and **SerpAPI**, deduplicates results, and validates credibility.  
- **Reporting Agent** ‚Üí Produces concise, well-structured reports in Markdown with findings, analysis, and citations.  
- **Orchestrator Agent** ‚Üí Coordinates all steps, ensures ordered execution, and provides debug streams (`[Plan Stream]`, `[Search Stream]`, `[Report Stream]`).  
- **Hybrid Search Strategy** ‚Üí Combines semantic search (Tavily) with broad web coverage (SerpAPI), ensuring resilience and source diversity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **User Query** ‚Üí Provide a natural-language question (e.g., *‚ÄúGive me updates in the world of tech?‚Äù*).  
2. **Plan Generation** ‚Üí Planning Agent outputs a structured research plan.  
3. **Hybrid Search** ‚Üí Tavily and SerpAPI APIs retrieve top results with metadata (title, description, URL, source, icon).  
4. **Report Generation** ‚Üí Reporting Agent synthesizes findings into a professional, 150‚Äì200 word Markdown report.  
5. **Orchestration** ‚Üí All agents are coordinated in sequence, preventing repetition and ensuring traceability.

Research Plan:
1. Search "major tech news 2025," "tech industry trends 2025," and "CES 2025 announcements" using reputable tech news outlets.
2. Identify significant product launches, AI advancements, policy changes, and major company acquisitions or partnerships reported for 2025.
3. Extract specific details such as dates, companies involved, and reported impacts from official company press releases and reputable financial news sources.
4. Validate and broaden context using specialist tech blogs, industry analyst reports, and discussions on professional tech forums or X (Twitter) for 2025 updates.
