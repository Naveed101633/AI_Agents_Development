# Handoffs Vs Orchestrator

OpenAI’s new **Agents SDK** brings agent-like behavior into LLM apps.

But two core ideas often confuse beginners:

- **Handoffs**
- **Orchestrator (Triage) Agents**

Let’s break them down 👇

## ❗ The issue with building single-purpose agents:

1. Most agents only know how to do *one* thing.
    
    ↳ For example, a product search agent can’t handle billing queries.
    
2. There’s no real coordination.
    
    ↳ If you have multiple agents, how do they know *when* to take over?
    
3. Without orchestration, you need custom logic to route user messages.
    
    ↳ You end up hardcoding flows or rules.
    

That’s where **handoffs** and an **orchestrator agent** come in.

Together, they enable **agent collaboration**, like a team that passes tasks and plays to each other's strengths.

## 🔄 So what is a “Handoff”?

A **handoff** is when one agent passes a task to another agent that’s more capable.

👉 Imagine a support agent receives a billing question. Instead of failing, it **hands off** the task to a billing agent.

**It’s dynamic. No rigid rules. Just cooperation.**

## 🧠 What’s an Orchestrator (Triage) Agent?

An **orchestrator agent** is the central brain 🧠.

> It doesn’t do the job itself — it assigns the right agent to do the job.
> 

It listens to user input and decides:

- Who should respond?
- Should we transfer this to someone else?

It can also reassign if the first agent struggles.

## 💡 Let’s see how this works in a real use case:

You have 3 agents:

- 🛍️ Product Search Agent
- 🙋 Customer Support Agent
- 💳 Billing Agent

And 1 🤖 Orchestrator (Triage) Agent

### Example Workflow:

Step 1) A user says: “I want to return an item and get a refund.”

Step 2) The **orchestrator** receives this.

Step 3) It analyzes and thinks:

↳ “This is a billing issue.”

Step 4) It performs a **handoff** to the **Billing Agent**.

Step 5) Billing Agent answers and resolves the query.

If the user suddenly says: “Actually, do you have this item in blue?”

Step 6) Billing Agent triggers a **handoff** back to the **Product Agent**.

All this happens smoothly — no hard rules, just intelligent routing.

## 🤖 Why this is powerful:

✅ You don’t hardcode logic

✅ You get modular, reusable agents

✅ Your system adapts to the conversation dynamically

✅ It scales well as you add more agent types
