**Why OpenAI Agents SDK should be the main framework for agentic development for most use cases?**
- It excels in simplicity and ease of use, making it the best choice for rapid development and broad accessibility.
- It offers high control with minimal abstraction, providing the flexibility needed for agentic development without the complexity of frameworks like LangGraph.
- It outperforms most alternatives (CrewAI, AutoGen, Google ADK, Dapr Agents) in balancing usability and power, and while LangGraph offers more control, its complexity makes it less practical for general use.

If your priority is ease of use, flexibility, and quick iteration in agentic development, OpenAI Agents SDK is the clear winner based on the table. However, if your project requires enterprise-scale features (e.g., Dapr Agents) or maximum control for complex workflows (e.g., LangGraph), you might consider those alternatives despite their added complexity.
